# AIMi10_for_AMLStudio
This is John Berk's first entry, setting up empty repo in GitHub first, then will clone to AML Studio and populate, commit, and sync back

John-Michael launched VSCode integrated terminal, and from there found that the newly made Git repo had been moved to the User/john account on the compute-ds11v2-aivisionT host...   but the AML Workspace editor and session were linked from that user's home direction to ~/cloudfiles/code/   so in the terminal, JM used the cp -r command to copy the full set of AIMi10_for_AMLStudio files TO the /cloudfiles/code/Users/john/AIMi10_for_AMLStudio   and voila, they showed up Where They Should have in AML Studio file system...   but when JM went to rm -r the original source, he got messages about not being the owner, and them being associated w Git...  deleted anyway... will try and sync the new copy...
